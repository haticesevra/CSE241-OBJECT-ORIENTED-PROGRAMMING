CSE241 - HOMEWORK 5

1- I described instructions in menu function(global)

2- I create objects for each class in order in main.

3- I wrote all functions you described in homework pdf.

4- There is an abstract base class (AbstractHex) and 3 derived classes (HexVector, HexArray1D, HexAdaptor).

5- HexVector and HexAdaptor class are similar in terms of function build.

6- HexArray1D class keep board using dynamic memory. Therefore it contains 'BIG THREE' in addition to other classes.

7- Except for two play() functions and my helper function generate_random(), all funnctions are virtual

8- The game is in namespace named 'sevraHexGame'.

9- I throw exceptions using try-catch blocks.

10- I use static_cast and dynamic_cast when overload = operator.

11- I wrote global function named board_validity (in main.cpp). This function takes board data and checks the characters is valid('x', 'o' ,'.') or not. It's return type is bool.
